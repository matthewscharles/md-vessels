This is a markdown version of patcher notation I have been working on, mostly for BtB Arts during our Sound Ideas sessions.

I needed a way to write out patches quickly on the fly, and having used it successfully for a few months, this is an attempt to formalise it.
The idea here is to develop a format that can translate well into a screen reader compatible layout and be navigated by keyboard or other input devices, with or without a screen reader.

Currently working with Jason Dasent through a @blurringtheboundaries project to ensure screen reader access.

Uploading some rough notes, this will be a bit of a testing ground since I'm working through a few issues specific to GitHub markdown at the time of writing.
