  "description": "This is a markdown version of patcher notation I have been working on, mostly for BtB Arts during our Sound Ideas sessions. I needed a way to write out patches quickly on the fly, and having used it successfully for a few months, this is an attempt to formalise it. The idea here is to develop a framework that can translate well into a screen reader compatible layout and be navigated by keyboard or other input devices, with or without a screen reader.",
